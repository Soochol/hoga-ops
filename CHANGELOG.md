## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-05-31

First versioned release. Captures the `feat+frontend5` work since the previous
merge to `main` (120 commits): the real-time `/live` experience, the watchlist
and Right Rail shell, and a pass of architecture-review refactors.

### Added
- **Single multiplexed WebSocket** for the frontend (ADR-0053): one `/api/ws`
  endpoint fans out both events and live snapshots, code-filtered, with
  automatic reconnect and a liveness watchdog that force-reconnects a silently
  dead socket. Honest connection-state surface (LIVE / stale chip + status dot).
- **Live chart**: adaptive KST x-axis via `createChartEx`, and viewport scale +
  position preserved across historical-prepend (no jump when older bars load).
- **Watchlist + Right Rail**: global rail chrome and Watchlist Panel mounted in
  the shell grid; active-symbol heart toggle; the live poller re-syncs to the
  watchlist immediately on add/remove (stops on empty, preserves the buffer).
- **Symbol search**: header inline search (`/` to focus) and a headless
  `useSymbolCombobox` hook (keyboard nav, highlight, dismiss-on-outside-click).
- **Page shell**: thin `PageContainer` frame with tokenized page padding;
  `--tint-success-border` / `--tint-error-border` design tokens.

### Changed
- Typed the live SSE/WebSocket payload contract end-to-end and the poller's
  `LiveSnapshot` builders; narrowed chart `SeriesSpec`/projector return types off
  `any` to the lightweight-charts vocabulary.
- Single-sourced duplicated domain rules: the Unix-ms → YYYYMMDD KST calendar-day
  conversion (`util/time`), the `first_*.tsv` page-layout contract
  (`collector/orchestrator`), and the Closing Auction Window length.
- Lifted inventory grouping + default-to-first policy to the page (`selectGroup`);
  extracted a single `FullCaptureCountBadge`; replaced the Optional timing
  collector with a `NullTimingCollector`.
- Adopted `PageContainer` across the capture, inventory, and watchlist pages;
  consolidated the capture-queue push subscription to a single owner.

### Fixed
- `candles.write_parquet` now writes atomically like its sibling tables (closes a
  torn-write window on the hot read-path parquet).
- `disk_state.classify_stock_date` returns the full `Classification`, dropping a
  second `meta.json` read on the hot decide-capture path.
- Corrected the Daily Scheduler fire-time docs (18:00 → 17:00 KST) and the false
  "drift caught by TypeScript" claim on the by-hand BE↔FE wire mirror (added a
  schema-diff guard test instead).
